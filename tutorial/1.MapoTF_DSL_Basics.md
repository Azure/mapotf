# MapoTF DSL Basics

## Introduction to the MapoTF DSL

Welcome to the world of MapoTF DSL, a powerful tool that lets you customize your Terraform configurations like never before! MapoTF DSL is built on the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), which means if you're already familiar with Terraform, you'll feel right at home. The main difference is that MapoTF DSL allows you to write code that can change other code â€“ yes, it's meta-programming at its best!

## First Steps with MapoTF DSL

Before we dive into writing our own MapoTF configurations, let's understand the basic structure. A typical MapoTF file will have one or more `transform` blocks, which are the heart of our DSL. Each `transform` block will look something like this:

```hcl
transform "update_in_place" "my_transform" {
  // Our custom logic will go here
}
```

Here, `update_in_place` is the type of transformation we want to apply, and `my_transform` is a unique name for this transformation.

## Querying Terraform Resources

To apply transformations, we first need to know what we're working with. In MapoTF, we use data blocks to query and fetch information about resources defined in our Terraform configurations:

```hcl
data "resource" "aks_clusters" {
  resource_type = "azurerm_kubernetes_cluster"
}
```

This will allow us to access all Azure Kubernetes Service clusters defined in our Terraform state.

## Applying Transformations

Now, let's apply a transformation. We'll use the transform block for this. Here's a simple example that adds some tags to our AKS clusters:

```hcl
transform "update_in_place" "add_tracing_tags" {
  for_each = data.resource.aks_clusters.result

  target_block_address = each.value.mptf.block_address

  asstring {
    tags = <<-TAGS
    merge({
        file = "${each.value.mptf.range.file_name}"
        block = "${each.value.mptf.terraform_address}"
        git_hash = "${each.value.mptf.module.git_hash}"
        module_source = "${each.value.mptf.module.source}"
        module_version = "${each.value.mptf.module.version}"
    }, ${try(each.value.tags, "{}")})
TAGS
  }
}
```

In this block:

* `for_each` iterates over each AKS cluster we fetched.
* `target_block_address` tells MapoTF which Terraform block to apply our changes to.
* Inside the `asstring` section, we define the logic for updating tags. The merge function combines existing tags with new ones we define.

## Understanding the Transformation Logic

The `asstring` block is where we write our logic in string format. This might look a bit different from what you're used to in Terraform, but it's a powerful way to customize your configurations. The tags attribute is set using a heredoc (indicated by <<-TAGS and TAGS), which allows us to write multi-line strings easily.

Inside the heredoc, we use the merge function to combine dictionaries. We're adding several key-value pairs that provide useful metadata about each block, such as the filename, block address, and Git hash of the module it comes from.

## Running Your First Transformation with Flags

To apply your transformation, you'll use the MapoTF command-line interface (CLI). The CLI is designed to be flexible and is controlled through a set of flags that let you specify how transformations should be applied. Here's how you can run your first transformation:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your Terraform project directory where your .tf files and MapoTF configurations are located.
3. Run the MapoTF CLI with the transform command, using the appropriate flags:

```shell
mapotf transform --tf-dir ./terraform --mptf-dir ./mapotf
```

4. Review the output of the command. The CLI will provide feedback on what it's doing, including any transformations applied and if there are errors to be aware of.
5. (Optional) Use additional flags for more control:
  - `--recursive` or `-r`: Apply transformations to all Terraform modules recursively. This is useful for large projects with multiple modules.
  - `--help`: If you need help or want to see all available flags and their descriptions.
6. Check your Terraform .tf files to see the changes applied by your transformation. The MapoTF CLI modifies these files based on the logic you defined in your MapoTF configurations.
7. Cleanup: If you want to revert the changes, you can run `mapotf reset`

## Recap

Congratulations! You've just learned the basics of the MapoTF DSL. You now know how to query resources, write transformation logic, and apply it to your Terraform configurations. In the next sections, we'll explore more advanced features and delve deeper into the power of MapoTF. Happy coding!
